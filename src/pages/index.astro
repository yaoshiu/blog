      <p>
        Fay Ash here. I'm currently a student at the

          <span i-fa6-solid:location-dot inline-block></span>
          <i>South West Petroleum University</i>
        </a>, majoring in Computer Science.
      </p>

      <p>My personal works:</p>
      <ul class="not-prose">
        {
          REPOS.map(({ repo, desc, icon }) => (
            <li>
              <RepoCard repo={repo} desc={desc} icon={icon} />
            </li>
          ))
        }
      </ul>

      <p>I am learning:</p>
      <ul>
        {
          LEARNING.map(({ title, tags }) => (
            <li>
              <strong>
                {title}
                {tags ? ':' : ''}
              </strong>
              {tags && (
                <ul class="not-prose" inline>
                  {tags.map(({ icon, name, href }) => (
                    <li class="inline">
                      <Tag {href} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        <svg class={`${icon} inline-block`} />
                        {name}
                      </Tag>
                    </li>
                  ))}
                </ul>
              )}
            </li>
          ))
        }
      </ul>

      <p>
        I often like to think of myself as a "creature driven by curiosity."
        When something sparks my interest, I can immerse myself in it for days
        without a wink of sleep. But if it doesn't captivate me, well, I might
        procrastinate for days, weeks, or even years. If you happen to share my
        passions, I believe you'll find something here that resonates with you.
        And if not, I apologize in advance for not satisfying your taste - at
        least not for now. But I'm always expanding my horizons, so perhaps one
        day you'll discover something here that catches your eye.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of programming, I might not be the most exciting person. Though
        I've dabbled a bit in image processing, I neither have the funds for a
        fancy camera nor the energy to travel widely, so you likely won't see
        any "photography masterpieces" here anytime soon. As a textbook nerd, I
        can't claim any prowess in sports either. Most of my free time revolves
        around the usual suspects: video games, music, and movies - a rather
        mainstream palette of interests.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to music and film, I'm still somewhat of a novice. For the
        first twenty years of my life, I only listened to pop music, and it's
        only in the last couple of years that I've ventured into other popular
        genres. I've been exploring notable albums from the 1960s and have only
        made it to the mid-1980s so far. So, for now, you could call me a
        "progressive rock and experimental music enthusiast" - yet another nerdy
        label to add to my collection. Movies are a similar story. I haven't
        even finished the top ten on the <i>Sight & Sound</i> list, and there are
        plenty of films I've struggled to sit through. Perhaps my tastes are still
        a bit unrefined, but I've forced myself through them for the sake of broadening
        my perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        But setting aside music and movies, I can confidently say I'm a seasoned
        gamer. I've dabbled in everything from action and racing games to card
        games, text adventures, and RPGs. My longest-running obsession is the
        <i>Monster Hunter</i> series, my favorite is <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i
        >, and I swear by the <i>GTA</i> series (since <i>GTA: Vice City</i> and
        <i>San Andreas</i> were my gateways into gaming). So if you're a fellow gaming
        enthusiast, you might just feel inclined to add me as a friend on
