So this is the new blog website, after abandoning countless other attempts, I hope this one will go longer.I made my mind to create this blog after visiting [Anthony Fu's amazing blog](https://antfu.me). So you can see that my blog shares a lot of similarities with his.

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Solid](https://solidjs.com), and hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com). I learned Solid for its great performance, and it drove me to create a blog website with this excellent framework, so Astro is the one to embed Solid in a SSG.

You can find the source code of this blog on [GitHub](https://github.com/yaoshiu/blog). It will be my honor if you liked my blog and fork it to create yours. So feel free to use the code, I will publish it under MIT license (or maybe some of you would prefer to call it Expat License).

I will write about my thoughts, my projects, and my life on this blog. I hope you enjoy reading it.
